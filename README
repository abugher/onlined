Description:

  Stay online.  This is like network-manager, but extremely dependent on
  ifupdown.
  
Depends:

  - iproute2
  - ifupdown

Assumptions:

  - All desirable network configurations are specified in Debian's ifupdown
    system.  (/etc/network/interfaces and /etc/network/interfaces.d/*)
  - Each desirable wired interface name is the name of an appropriate
    specification.
  - Each desirable wireless network name is the name of an appropriate
    specification.
  - Only ipv4 is in use.
