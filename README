Checking online status:  There are few ways to do this.  "Online" is vague.

- Check connectivity to a specific address.
  - Requires sending traffic.
  - Announces presence to that address.
  - Announces an identifying quirk to the LAN.
- Watch traffic.
  - Outbound packets mean we're trying.
  - Inbound packets mean we're online.
  - Lack of traffic could mean offline, or could mean calm.
    - Maybe require one of a few constant traffic generators, like NTP.
  - Watch for traffic routed through the default gateway.
  - Watch for traffic not matching any routing rule, other than default gateway.  (...a method for above, I guess.)
    - Elegant.
    - Gonna take a minute to code.
  - Watch for traffic not to this subnet.
    - Assumes that "the LAN" consists of one subnet.
    - Most of the code is written.
    - This seems like the way to prototype, then maybe graduate to matching against all routing rules.
    - More than one subnet accessible by the same machine implies the machine is a router.  That's not my use case.
